Theoretical Questions:

1.
a:
In order to support the new command on the client should only add "leave_group" command to
its enum of supported inputs. Other than that the client sends the request to the server
as it is, so no more further changes are needed.

b: 
In order to support the new command on the server side, a handler for "leave_group" neeeds
to be defined, same as it has for other possible actions of the client.

2.
We prefer TCP over UDP in this exercise since TCP is all about this reliability â€” it gurantees
that no data is lost or corrupted in transit.
In our messaging app we need to guarantee two essential things: data to be sent
in the same order of requests and safe transit to ensure whole data is completely delivered.

3.
When using UDP There is no guarantee we get all the data which were sent, and there is no way
to ask for a data again if we miss it, but losing all this overhead means the computers
can communicate more quickly.
UDP is used when speed is desirable and error correction is not necessary.
Two examples which require quick communication over errors correction are live broadcasts and online games.

4.
One design could be writing all client's and server's stdin and stdout to a file (server will write also its clients, groups, etc) 
on a hard drive every some time, or several commands.
In order to restore the data, connection to the server will require username and password to avoid hostile usage.
When server is up and running again it will read from the file the clients that were connected and try to re-establish connection automatically
and restruct their groups. When a client is connected again it could restore its last data from the saved file.
