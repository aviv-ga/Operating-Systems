Exercise 2

Part 2: Theoretical Questions

1. A program that can put user-level threads into good use is a web browser. For example,
while waiting for some server to respond on thread, we would like to run another thread.
This is possible only when implementing the browser by user-level threads, as we define its
control flow and synchronization, and do not depend on the OS.

2. Advantages:
a) No code sharing between tabs. Improves safety, i.e. one tab cannot manipulate another.
b) Tabs are independent. If one thread of a tab is blocked by the kernel, then only this tab is blocked.
Disadvantages:
a) The browser runs slower. Each tab change requires a costly context switch between processes.

3. The kill pid command sends a signal to the process specified by pid. If no argument is written after pid,
the default signal sent is the SIGKILL signal, which terminates the process.
The SIGKILL signal can not be caught, blocked or ignored.
uring the command SIGRTMIN and SIGRT_1 are masked in order to avoid problems with its termination.

4.
Virtual time - Abstract notion of time, that does not necessarily have correlation with 'real' time,
i.e. the real amount of time units that have passed since two points of measurement.
Example: Synchronization of processes or threads.
Real time - Notion of time that has a relation with the 'real' time that has passed between any two points of
measurement.
Example: A program that increments the amount of days passed everyday at midnight:)
The time we wait for a server to respond is real time.
